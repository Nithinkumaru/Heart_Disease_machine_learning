# Heart Disease Prediction System

### Internship Project at Unified Mentor | Machine Learning Industry Training

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project, developed during my internship with Unified Mentor, focuses on creating a predictive model to identify the likelihood of heart disease in patients. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model aims to support early detection and prevention efforts in healthcare.

### **Objective**
Build a reliable system that predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient data and clinical parameters.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Data-Driven Predictions:** Utilizes structured datasets to train the model with clinical parameters known to impact heart health.
- **Real-World Application:** Aims to provide healthcare professionals with a supportive tool for early diagnosis.
- **User-Friendly Insights:** Designed to simplify complex data for easy interpretation and action.

---

## 🧬 Dataset & Parameters

The project uses [Dataset Name/Source] consisting of various health indicators:

- **Age** - Patient age
- **Gender** - Patient gender
- **Blood Pressure** - Systolic and diastolic readings
- **Cholesterol Levels** - Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides
- **Max Heart Rate Achieved**
- **Exercise-Induced Angina** - Presence or absence of angina during physical exertion
- **Blood Sugar Levels** - Fasting blood sugar
- **Electrocardiographic Results** - ECG readings
- **Chest Pain Type** - Types of chest pain experienced
- **...and other health metrics**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📈 Machine Learning Approach

The model is trained using algorithms known for high accuracy in classification tasks, including:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Each model’s performance was evaluated, and the one with the highest accuracy was selected for deployment.

---

## 🚀 Results

The model achieved an accuracy of XX%, enabling a meaningful predictive capability. This tool can provide healthcare professionals with insights that support clinical decision-making.
